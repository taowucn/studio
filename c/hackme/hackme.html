		<p>A friend recently asked me to find the password for a little
		hard-to-hack program he had written and I agreed to it. The
		short journey of a few hours that led me to its password were
		extremely interesting and this article describes the process as
		well as some of the new techniques learnt along the way.</p>

		<p>Few minutes after accepting his challenge, I received the
		binary in an E-mail and I was on it! Those interested in giving
		it a shot can download <a href="./hackme">the binary</a> file
		and get back to this article later. Do let me know if you find
		anything interesting along the way that I did not think of or
		missed! Comments can be sent to manohar dot vanga at gmail dot
		com with the title [hackme].</p>

		<div class="subhead"><h2>Test Run</h2></div>

		<p>I ran the binary and tried a couple of random passwords. As
		expected, they failed, providing me with an extremely helpful
		message:</p>
		<div class="code"><code><pre>$ ./hackme
Password, please? password
Oops..
</pre></code></div>

		<p>Interestingly, running the binary under GDB gives a specially
		crafted welcome message:</p>

		<div class="code"><code><pre>$ $ gdb ./hackme 
Reading symbols from /tmp/hack/hackme...(no
debugging symbols found)...done.
(gdb) r
Starting program: ./hackme 
<b>Fuck off! no debuggers!</b>

Program exited with code 0364.
(gdb) 
</pre></code></div>

		<p>Same with ptrace:</p>

		<div class="code"><code><pre>$ strace ./hackme 
execve("./hackme", ["./hackme"], [/* 41 vars */]) = 0
brk(0)                                  = 0x9016000
access("/etc/ld.so.nohwcap", F_OK)      = -1 ENOENT (No such
file or directory)
... snip ...
ptrace(PTRACE_TRACEME, 0, 0, 0)         = -1 EPERM (Operation
not permitted)
fstat64(1, {st_mode=S_IFCHR|0620, st_rdev=makedev(136, 3), ...})
= 0
mmap2(NULL, 4096, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE,
MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0) = 0xb783e000
<b>write(1, "Fuck off! no debuggers!\n", 24Fuck off! no debuggers!
) = 24</b>
_exit(2543604)                          = ?
</pre></code></div>

		<div class="subhead"><h2>The Obvious Stuff</h2></div>

		<p>Even though the probability of a password being visible in
		plain sight was near zero, I decided to give it a shot
		anyway.</p>

		<p>First, I checked if the binary was stripped or not:</p>

		<div class="code"><code><pre>$ file hackme
hackme: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically
linked (uses shared libs), for GNU/Linux 2.6.27, stripped
</pre></code></div>
		
		<p>It was stripped. Dead end there. GDB won't be much help with
		a stripped binary in terms of deconstructing the logic. I
		decided to try looking for a literal string comparison with the
		password just in case:</p>

		<div class="code"><code><pre>$ strings hackme
/lib/ld-linux.so.2
libdl.so.2
__gmon_start__
_Jv_RegisterClasses
dlopen
dlsym
libc.so.6
_IO_stdin_used
__libc_start_main

&amp;64;3
%'&lt;;!3
UWVS
[^_]
Fuck off! no debuggers!
Password, please? 
Congratulations!
Oops..
</pre></code></div>

		<p>Just in case, I try all the strings as passwords but they all
		fail. Not too surprising. The output however gives us the
		message that gets printed on success; "Congratulations!". It
		also seems to be containing the string "libc.so.6" Fishy. A
		quick ltrace quickly explains what the binary is doing:</p>

		<div class="code"><code><pre>$ ltrace ./hackme 
__libc_start_main(0x8048645, 1, 0xbfb48a04, 0x80486b0, 0x8048720
&lt;unfinished ...&gt;
dlopen("/lib/libc.so.6", 2)
= 0xb7757ae0
dlsym(0xb7757ae0, "ptrace")
= 0x00eddf40
dlsym(0xb7757ae0, "scanf")
= 0x00e621a0
dlsym(0xb7757ae0, "printf")
= 0x00e5baa0
Fuck off! no debuggers!
+++ exited (status 244) +++
</pre></code></div>
		
		<p>While this gives us the same welcoming message, we can see
		what is happening here. The libc shared library is being opened
		dynamically and the addresses of ptrace, scanf and printf are
		being retreived with dlsym! Sneaky trick!</p>

		<p>More irritatingly however, the strings output shows that the
		binary is using the random() function. However, since it is a
		reproducible program, that is the password works every time, the
		call to random is probably not being seeded. We will worry about
		this later.</p>

		<p>The strings output also explains how the binary is detecting
		the debugging environment. Calling ptrace while running inside a
		ptraced environment (eg. strace, ltrace or gdb) returns -1.</p>

		<p>Getting over this hurdle however is quite easy using the
		LD_PRELOAD environment variable. The LD_PRELOAD environment
		variable can contain a list of custom shared objects which then
		get loaded prior to all others when running an executable. It is
		an easy route to blocking a process from calling unwanted
		functions. I quickly put aside this hurdle with a quick dummy
		function in a new file:</p>

		<div class="code"><code><pre>/* fake ptrace() */
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

long ptrace(int x, int y, int z)
{
	printf("B-)\n");
	return 0;
}
</pre></code></div>

		<p>I quickly compiled it:</p>

		<div class="code"><code><pre>gcc -shared -fPIC -o fake.so fake.c
</pre></code></div>

		<p>Now running under strace with the LD_PRELOAD variable set to
		our fake shared object gives us the full scoop!</p>

		<div class="code"><code><pre>$ strace -E LD_PRELOAD=./fake.so ./hackme

		<p>Looks like the password buffer is 1024 bytes long. I could
		try overflowing that but coupled with stack randomization, it
		would be a hard to do on a lazy Friday. More importantly, my
		goal is not the break the program but to get the password!<p>

		<p>It is starting to seem like my only option left is to sit and
		reverse engineer the code for this binary; something I did not
		want to get in to on a Friday afternoon. A geek challenge
		however trumps laziness any day of the week so I started with
		the task of disassembling the binary.</p>

		<div class="subhead"><h2>Disassembly</h2></div>

		<p>I started with an objdump output to deconstruct (go ahead and
		open it in a new tab if you want to follow along):</p>

		<div class="code"><code><pre>$ objdump -D ./hackme &gt; <a
href="objdumpout.txt">out.asm</a>
</pre></code></div>

		<p>The assembly is a mess as expected of a stripped binary. I
		quickly need to find the part that pertains to the password
		encryption logic. From the test run, I know that the logic is
		somewhere between where it prints the "Password, please?"
		message and the "Oops.." message. I will start by locating these
		strings in the assembly output. The "Pa" of "Password" from the
		"Password, please?" string is 50 followed by 61 in
		hexadecimal. A quick search locates the string in the assembly
		output:</p>

		<div class="code"><code><pre>$ grep "50 61" objdumpout.txt 
 8048798:	00 <b>50 61</b>             	add    %dl,0x61(%eax)
</pre></code></div>

		<p>The address of the string therefore is 0x8048799 (since the
		first byte needs to be skipped). Heading over to this address
		with a quick search leads me to this code:</p>

		<div class="code"><code><pre> 804859d:       68 99 87 04 08          push   $0x8048799
 80485a2:       ff 15 94 99 04 08       call   *0x8049994
</pre></code></div>

		<p>Great! It is pushing the address of the string (as a literal)
		on to the stack and calling an address. I assume that this
		address is the address returned by dlsym for printf.</p>

		<p>Now I need to find the "Oops.." message. I repeat the same
		procedure to get to the string and find the code:</p>

		<div class="code"><code><pre> 8048633:       68 c1 87 04 08          push   $0x80487c1
 8048638:       ff d0                   call   *%eax
</pre></code></div>

		<p>While I am at it, I pick out the "Congratulations!" message
		as well and find the location. Finally the code looks much more
		comprehensible:</p>

		<div class="code"><code><pre>

		<p>Phew! That was not as bad as I expected! Converting that
		logic to C code that dumps out the password took me a while
		with testing and the final result looked like the following:</p>

		<div class="code"><code><pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;

int main()
{
	int i, j, edi;
	char buf[50], ch;
	char out[50];
	unsigned char check;
	int ret = 0, val, len, rem;
	int magic;
	int k;
	unsigned char arr[] = {0x6a, 0xfb, 0x4c, 0x8d, 0x58, 0x0f, 0xd4, 0xe8,
		0x94, 0x98, 0xee, 0x6b, 0x18, 0x30, 0xe0, 0x55, 0xc5, 0x28,
		0x0e};
	
	for (i = 0; i &lt; 19; i++)
		out[i] = 'x';
	out[i] = '\0';

	for (i = 10; i &gt; 0; i--) {
		int m2;

		val = random();
		rem = val%19;
		check = arr[rem] &amp; 0xff;
		ch = buf[rem++];

		j = 0;
		magic = 0;
		printf("rem = %d\n", rem);
		while (j &lt; rem) {
			magic *= 1828812941;
			magic += 12345;
			j++;
		}
		m2 = magic;

		magic ^= ch;
		out[rem - 1] = (m2 &amp; 0xff) ^ (check &amp; 0xff));
	}
	printf("Password: %s\n", out);
}
</pre></code></div>

		<p>Now for the fun; the output:</p>

		<div class="code"><code><pre>$ ./decompiled
rem = 3
rem = 16
rem = 4
rem = 4
rem = 11
rem = 9
rem = 11
rem = 12
rem = 3
rem = 8
Password: xxsaxxxpexYoxxxexxx
</pre></code></div>

		<p>The loop in the binary runs only 10 times and it has
		repeating checks for some offsets of the password. The only
		characters of the password that matter are the ones NOT marked
		with an 'x' in the output (I make the program set these as it
		runs).</p>

		<p>Now the sweet part! I run the password against the original
		program:</p>

		<div class="code"><code><pre>$ ./hackme 
Password, please? xxsaxxxpexYoxxxexxx
Congratulations!
	</div>

		<p>HA! That was fun!</p>

		<div class="subhead"><h2>Conclusions</h2></div>

		<p>So what did I learn?</p>
		
		<b>Know Thy Tools</b>
		<p>I knew how to get around many of the hurdles I faced from
		past knowledge and experiences with the various tools I used.
		The better you know your tools, the more you can think about the
		real issues at hand (in this case, reversing the program
		logic).</p>

		<b>Test the Waters</b>
		<p>I knew I would find an easy way to reverse this program but I
		tried all the easy routes anyway. Even though it helped did not
		provide me with much information, I gained confidence after
		having eliminated some of the options. It cleared the way
		forward.</p>

		<b>Know Thy Assembly</b>
		<p>The machine instructions were a little hard to decompile and
		I found myself referencing the Intel manuals from time to time
		to figure out what was going on. More than the assembly itself
		though, I really recommend learning the GNU Assembler syntax. I
		was familiar with the Intel syntax (eg. NASM) but not completely
		proficient with GAS syntax (AT&amp;T syntax). I found <a
		href="http://www.imada.sdu.dk/Courses/DM18/Litteratur/IntelnATT.htm">this article</a>
		and <a href="http://sig9.com/articles/att-syntax">this article</a>
		very useful in quickly brushing this up.</p>

		<p>Some thoughts on the program itself follow</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Checking only few parts of the password was
			ineffective although it would not have made life much
			more difficult if every character was checked. (Note: The
			original author told me he put the 10 in for debugging
			purposes and forgot to change it)</li>
			<li>The random number was a nice way to scare me a
			little but in the end, it had to be unseeded to be
			deterministic and consequently, not very effective. If I
			had a different version of libc with a different
			random(), the program would probably have failed with
			the original password.</li>
			<li>The actual password was "SesameOpenYourself!"! I
			came up with a few nonsensical variations that worked as
			well. eg. "NasaJeeperYouShelby".</li>
		</ul>

		<p>All in all, a good friday afternoon! Again, comments can be
		mailed to manohar dot vanga at gmail dot com with a title of
